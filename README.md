# URE
Thank you for choosing the Universal Runtime Environment (URE) as your
environment of your operating system for you
help to create well your own universal programming language and
help other programmers use your new language to
any language in the world. The problem that causes
other people in some countries are unable to master the
computer programming, is the lack of understanding of
syntaxes used obligatorily in English. The only thing to know is
that, it is not mandatory that people learn to program by
English while they do not even understand the words used for the
algorithmic programming of any application. The rate of
misunderstanding of computer programming exceeds more than
75% in several countries because of a language used and imposed in the
whole world. But the solution is now within everyone's reach.
world so that you and I can change not only your
countries, but also to change the whole world. At the end of the reading, you
be able to design your own programming language
universal, programmable and comprehensive in all the languages ​​of the
world or even unknown extra-terrestrial languages.

# Features
The Universal Runtime Environment makes your job easier with:

# The integrated universal debugger:
Capable of detecting errors in the syntaxes used by programming languages universal, adapted and multilingual.

# Appropriate Syntax Security:
Secures your syntax language programming or executable application, so that no one no one else can modify it without your permission.

# Formal or other language:
You will be free to program at any native or other language in the world.

# Cross platforms:
As long as the execution environment universal (EEU) is cross-platform, programmable and executable in all operating systems, your programming language programming will also be.
