# Introduction
Thank you for choosing the Universal Execution Environment (EEU) as your
that the primary environment of your operating system for you
help to properly create your own universal programming language and
to help other programmers use your new language
any language in the world. The problem that causes
other people in some countries cannot master the
computer programming, is the lack of understanding of
syntaxes used obligatorily in English. The only thing to know is
that, it is not obligatory that people learn to program in
English while they do not even understand the words used for the
algorithmic programming of any application. The rate of
the incomprehension of computer programming exceeds more than
75% in several countries because of a language used and imposed in the
whole world. But the solution is now within everyone's reach.
world so that you and I can change not only your
country, but also to change the whole world. At the end of reading, you
be able to design your own programming language
universal, programmable and comprehensive in all languages of the
world or even unknown extra-terrestrial languages.

# Features
The universal runtime environment makes your tasks easier with:

 The integrated universal debugger: Capable of detecting errors
in the syntaxes used by programming languages
universal, adapted and multilingual.

 Appropriate syntax security: Secures your language
programming or executable application, so that no one
no one else can modify it without your permission.

 Formal or other language: You will be free to program at
any native or other language in the world.

 Cross platforms: As long as the execution environment
universal (EEU) is cross-platform, programmable and
executable in all operating systems, your language
programming too will be.
