# Introduction
Thank you for choosing the Universal Execution Environment (EEU) as your
that the primary environment of your operating system for you
help to properly create your own universal programming language and
to help other programmers use your new language
any language in the world. The problem that causes
other people in some countries cannot master the
computer programming, is the lack of understanding of
syntaxes used obligatorily in English. The only thing to know is
that, it is not obligatory that people learn to program in
English while they do not even understand the words used for the
algorithmic programming of any application. The rate of
the incomprehension of computer programming exceeds more than
75% in several countries because of a language used and imposed in the
whole world. But the solution is now within everyone's reach.
world so that you and I can change not only your
country, but also to change the whole world. At the end of reading, you
be able to design your own programming language
universal, programmable and comprehensive in all languages of the
world or even unknown extra-terrestrial languages.

# Features
The universal runtime environment makes your tasks easier with:

 The integrated universal debugger: Capable of detecting errors
in the syntaxes used by programming languages
universal, adapted and multilingual.

 Appropriate syntax security: Secures your language
programming or executable application, so that no one
no one else can modify it without your permission.

 Formal or other language: You will be free to program at
any native or other language in the world.

 Cross platforms: As long as the execution environment
universal (EEU) is cross-platform, programmable and
executable in all operating systems, your language
programming too will be.


# 1. What is the universal runtime environment ?
The universal execution environment (EEU or in English URE), is a
computing environment enabling all computer programmers
around the world to easily develop their applications, systems and more
thanks to its structure for debugging and executing programs written in
different languages or different ways for the best understanding,
security of coded information or security of syntax used by
programmers. Its algorithm was developed using the language
assembly (ASM) or machine language, C/C++ by the developer Guyllit
Aneto Minanga of Congolese nationality.

# 1.1. Objective :
For expert developers, the objective is to help them adapt their
systems, integrated development environment (EDI or IDE) and languages
programming to the universal execution environment offered by the
incorporated company AnetoEnterprise Inc so that other programmers
beginners or even experts can understand the syntaxes and design
applications or systems of the future.

In case of beginner IT developers or IT students,
the goal is to make computer programming easier for everyone
comprehensive levels, so that in each country students
understand the structure and appropriate behavior of each system
operating and programming language.

In some countries, specifically in Africa, students are ordered not to
be up to date with other students occupying the different
remaining continents that we have not mentioned. Let's take an example of a
computer programming language released in 2019 or 2020 by a
American designed completely with Anglo-Saxon syntaxes, students
or even new teachers in a French-speaking or other country, do not
will not be able to adapt quickly at the same time as
American students or English-speaking students. Some African students
English speakers will understand the entire syntaxes of this language proposed by its
developer and others will never understand the syntaxes or perhaps the
Understanding will come after a few years of repetition. This is what makes
that understanding is not necessarily adapted in all countries and not at the same time of learning. It is because of this disadvantage that the
Africans are a little weak in inventing or innovating on a daily basis.

# 1.2. Idea :
The idea is to make a computer programming language
developed in English, Tshiluba, Lingala or Swahili for example, targeting a
assembly programming language (ASM) which is the language close to
machine, or manipulated by programmers from all countries and using
any language with suitable comprehensive syntaxes and not
only the Anglo-Saxon syntaxes as always done since the
decades.

With the Universal Runtime Environment, a US developer can
create your computer programming system or language in English,
on the other hand, an African can develop his own and both languages
computer systems developed by two different nationalities, using two
languages different from syntaxes or instructions, are manipulated
correctly and that they are translated in each country to a language
understanding of the students. Meaning that American students or
English speakers using the English language could learn a language of
programming created in Africa in Lingala, French or Tshiluba for example,
without any difficulty. Even for Africans could study a
programming language developed by an American in English, i.e.
understanding in Lingala, Kikongo, Tshiluba, French or even English
default language of this programming language.

# 1.3. Conclusion :
Even if repetition is the mother of science as we say, this
inferiority or superiority complex of using only one language to
the advancement of technology should change completely is that in every
continent and in each country that there is invention, innovation and
understanding ensure for everyone as long as computers,
mobile phones or other electronic devices do not experience any
human formal language. And it’s thanks to a unique programming language
assembly, otherwise called assembler designed for processors, our
formal languages use it for translation and execution of programs
computers.

So why force people to only one language before handling
a new invention or innovation?
Because the inventors or innovators are English-speaking?

# 2. What is a universal runtime environment ?
To better understand the execution environment, an environment
execution or runtime in English, is software responsible for the execution
computer programs written in a language
given programming. A runtime provides execution services
programs such as input-output, stopping processes, using
operating system services, processing of calculation errors,
generation of events, use of services offered in another language
programming, and debugging (Debugger).

A runtime can be seen as a virtual machine: in the same way
that native code is executed by the processor, object code is executed by the
runtime. The runtime is then used to execute object code by putting the code
native available to the processor for execution.

# In this sense we can say that:
The runtime is the interpreter: it interprets the source code, manipulates the variables,
reserves memory and supports runtime errors and can
accompanied by a standard library. It implements the functionalities
elementary of the language, while the standard library is typically
written in the language itself.

As for the universal runtime environment (URE), controls the execution of
programs in different programming languages, using the
different languages in the world and provides services. These services are
exposed exactly even if the programming languages involved
use different languages from different programmers around the world.
However, the range of functions is the same in all languages and they
are implemented by the same universal execution environment.

it is not only for running cross-platform applications,
also considered as an execution environment in the same way as a
operating system (SE or OS), also makes it easier to use or
programming computer languages so that every programmer in
the different countries, using the different language that its designer, arrives at
understand the syntaxes proposed for the chosen language so that the future of
inventions and innovations are assured.

Let's take an example of two neighbors, one of whom is bilingual who
speaks very well in French and Lingala. While the other expresses himself
only in Lingala. The two neighbors have one child each. But, one of the
neighbors her child also understands both languages (French and Lingala) as much
that his mother often learns.

So, the neighbor who speaks only in Lingala sends her child to the
bilingual neighbor in order to recover her money that she had lent to her friend
(The other neighbor).

To better understand this little story or procedure carried out in a
computer, mobile phone or others, one of the neighbors who is bilingual is the
computer operating system, the other neighbor is indeed the software
or the application created by a computer programmer.

The two children, that of the bilingual neighbor, are an environment
execution and the other child, is a programming language used at
design of the software or application by the computer programmer.

Which results in 4 Fictional Characters from the story or procedures assigned in
a computer :

 The operating system: The bilingual neighbor;
 Software: The Lingala-speaking neighbor mom;
 Execution environment: The child of the bilingual neighbor;
 The programming language: The mother next door’s child
lingalaphone.

Now you will understand what happens in a computer,
mobile phone or other devices used by computer programs.
The Lingala-speaking neighbor mother easily sends her child in Lingala in order to go
get the money back. The child (Programming language) arrives at the destination
and hits the door, the other child (Execution environment) rushes to
look to see if it is who it is to listen and understand what this child is going to do
ask. Once the request is readable with exact words (Syntaxes), it
transmits the same request to its mother (Operating System) in order to
check if she really has the money. In case of success or otherwise that its
mother does not have the money, she sends the answer or the money back to her child and the child
in turn transmits the response received or the money received to the child who was in
waiting in front of the door. Furthermore, if the words or syntax of the request have not
not been correctly defined, the universal execution environment
(The bilingual child) detects and returns errors to the programming language
waiting for the response (The child waiting) in order to transmit it to the software
or application (His mother).

NB: With this example, he shows us that the Lingala-speaking neighbor mother and
their child no longer needs to know or necessarily learn the
exact language that their neighbors use in order to adapt it and apply it in their
House.
